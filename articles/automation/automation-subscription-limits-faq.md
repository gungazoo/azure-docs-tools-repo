# Azure Automation limits and quotas

Azure Automation will soon revise its service and subscription limits to ensure fair distribution of cloud resources across all customers. This change is another step to improve the reliability and performance of the service while optimizing resource utilization. Since the resource requirements vary across organizations and evolve over time, we aim to empower customers to configure their quotas based on actual usage.
