# Quickstart: Use Azure Cache for Redis with an ASP.NET Core web app

In this quickstart, you incorporate Azure Cache for Redis into an ASP.NET Core web application that connects to Azure Cache for Redis to store and retrieve data from the cache.

There are also caching providers in .NET core. To quickly start using Redis with minimal changes to your existing code, see:

- [ASP.NET core Output Cache provider](/aspnet/core/performance/caching/output#redis-cache)
- [ASP.NET core Distributed Caching provider](/aspnet/core/performance/caching/distributed#distributed-redis-cache)
- [ASP.NET core Redis session provider](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/app-state#configure-session-state)

## Skip to the code on GitHub

Clone the [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cache-redis-samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cache-redis-samples) GitHub repo and navigate to the `quickstart/aspnet-core` directory to view the completed source code for the steps ahead.

The `quickstart/aspnet-core` directory is also configured as an [Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview) template. Use the open-source `azd` tool to streamline the provisioning and deployment from a local environment to Azure. Optionally, run the `azd up` command to automatically provision an Azure Cache for Redis instance, and to configure the local sample app to connect to it:

```azdeveloper
azd up
```

### Explore the eShop sample

As a next step, you can see a real-world scenario eShop application demonstrating the ASP.NET core caching providers: [ASP.NET core eShop using Redis caching providers](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cache-redis-demos).

Features included:

- Redis Distributed Caching
- Redis session state provider

Deployment instructions are in the README.md.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

## Create a cache

[!INCLUDE [redis-cache-create](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-cache-for-redis/includes/redis-cache-create-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cache-entra-access](includes/cache-entra-access.md)]

[!INCLUDE [redis-access-policy](includes/redis-access-policy.md)]

## Add a local secret for the host name

In your command window, execute the following command to store a new secret named *RedisHostName*, after replacing the placeholders, including angle brackets, for your cache name and primary access key:

```dos
dotnet user-secrets set RedisHostName "<cache-name>.redis.cache.windows.net"
```

For using Azure Managed Redis (preview) instance, store a new secret named RedisHostName as below:

```dos
dotnet user-secrets set RedisHostName "<cache-name>.<region>.redis.azure.net"
```

## Connect to the cache with RedisConnection

The `RedisConnection` class manages the connection to your cache. The connection is made in this statement in `HomeController.cs` in the *Controllers* folder:

```csharp
_redisConnection = await _redisConnectionFactory;
```

The `RedisConnection.cs` class includes the `StackExchange.Redis` and `Azure.Identity` namespaces at the top of the file to include essential types to connect to Azure Cache for Redis.

```csharp
using StackExchange.Redis;
using Azure.Identity;
```

The `RedisConnection` code ensures that there's always a healthy connection to the cache by managing the `ConnectionMultiplexer` instance from `StackExchange.Redis`. The `RedisConnection` class recreates the connection when a connection is lost and unable to reconnect automatically.

For more information, see [StackExchange.Redis](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/) and the code in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis).

## Layout views in the sample

The home page layout for this sample is stored in the *_Layout.cshtml* file. From this page, you start the actual cache testing by clicking the **Azure Cache for Redis Test** from this page.

1. Open *Views\Shared\\_Layout.cshtml*.

1. You should see in `<div class="navbar-header">`:

    ```html
    <a class="navbar-brand" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="RedisCache">Azure Cache for Redis Test</a>
    ```

### Showing data from the cache

From the home page, you select **Azure Cache for Redis Test** to see the sample output.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Views** folder, and then right-click the **Home** folder.

1. You should see this code in the *RedisCache.cshtml* file.

    ```csharp
    @{
        ViewBag.Title = "Azure Cache for Redis Test";
    }

    <h2>@ViewBag.Title.</h2>
    <h3>@ViewBag.Message</h3>
    <br /><br />
    <table border="1" cellpadding="10">
        <tr>
            <th>Command</th>
            <th>Result</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>@ViewBag.command1</td>
            <td><pre>@ViewBag.command1Result</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>@ViewBag.command2</td>
            <td><pre>@ViewBag.command2Result</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>@ViewBag.command3</td>
            <td><pre>@ViewBag.command3Result</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>@ViewBag.command4</td>
            <td><pre>@ViewBag.command4Result</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>@ViewBag.command5</td>
            <td><pre>@ViewBag.command5Result</pre></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    ```

## Run the app locally

1. Execute the following command in your command window to build the app:

    ```dos
    dotnet build
    ```

1. Then run the app with the following command:

    ```dos
    dotnet run
    ```

1. Browse to `https://localhost:5001` in your web browser.

1. Select **Azure Cache for Redis Test** in the navigation bar of the web page to test cache access.
