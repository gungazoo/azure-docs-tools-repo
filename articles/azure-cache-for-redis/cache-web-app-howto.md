# Quickstart: Use Azure Cache for Redis with an ASP.NET web app

In this quickstart, you use Visual Studio 2019 to create an ASP.NET web application that connects to Azure Cache for Redis to store and retrieve data from the cache. You then deploy the app to Azure App Service.

## Skip to the code on GitHub

Clone the repo [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cache-redis-samples/tree/main/quickstart/aspnet](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cache-redis-samples/tree/main/quickstart/aspnet) on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet)
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with the **ASP.NET and web development** and **Azure development** workloads.

## Create a cache

Next, you create the cache for the app.

[!INCLUDE [redis-cache-create](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-cache-for-redis/includes/redis-cache-create.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cache-entra-access](includes/cache-entra-access.md)]

### To edit the *CacheSecrets.config* file

1. Create a file on your computer named *CacheSecrets.config*. Put it in a location where it won't be checked in with the source code of your sample application. For this quickstart, the *CacheSecrets.config* file is located at *C:\AppSecrets\CacheSecrets.config*.

1. Edit the *Web.config* file. Then add the following content:

    ```xml
    <appSettings>
        <add key="RedisHostName" value="<cache-hostname>:<port-number>"/>
    </appSettings>
    ```

1. Replace `<cache-hostname>` with your cache host name as it appears in the Overview blade of Azure Portal

1. Replace `<port-number>` with your cache host port number.

1. Save the file.

## Update the MVC application

In this section, you can see an MVC application that presents a view that displays a simple test against Azure Cache for Redis. The MVC application can connect to your Azure Managed Redis (preview) instance when the "RedisHostName" configuration points to your Azure Managed Redis instance.


## Install StackExchange.Redis

Your solution needs the `StackExchange.Redis` package to run. Install it, with this procedure:

1. To configure the app to use the [StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis) NuGet package for Visual Studio, select **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console**.

1. Run the following command from the `Package Manager Console` window:

    ```powershell
    Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.StackExchangeRedis
    ```

1. The NuGet package downloads and adds the required assembly references for your client application to access Azure Cache for Redis with the `Microsoft.Azure.StackExchangeRedis` client.

<!--

Philo - Isn't this superfluous now? 

1. If you prefer to use a strong-named version of the `StackExchange.Redis` client library, install the `StackExchange.Redis` package.
 -->

## Connect to the cache with RedisConnection

The connection to your cache is managed by the `RedisConnection` class. The connection is first made in this statement from `ContosoTeamStats/Controllers/HomeController.cs`:

```csharp
private static Task<RedisConnection> _redisConnectionFactory = RedisConnection.InitializeAsync(redisHostName: ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["RedisHostName"].ToString());

```

In `RedisConnection.cs`, you see the `StackExchange.Redis` namespace has been added to the code. This is needed for the `RedisConnection` class.

```csharp
using StackExchange.Redis;
```

The `RedisConnection` code ensures that there is always a healthy connection to the cache by managing the `ConnectionMultiplexer` instance from `StackExchange.Redis`. The `RedisConnection` class recreates the connection when a connection is lost and unable to reconnect automatically.

The following line of code uses Microsoft Entra ID to connect to Azure Cache for Redis or Azure Managed Redis (preview) without password.

```csharp
var configurationOptions = await ConfigurationOptions.Parse($"{_redisHostName}").ConfigureForAzureWithTokenCredentialAsync(new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

For more information, see [StackExchange.Redis](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/) and the code in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis).

## Layout views in the sample

The home page layout for this sample is stored in the *_Layout.cshtml* file. From this page, you start the actual cache testing by clicking the **Azure Cache for Redis Test** from this page.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Views** > **Shared** folder. Then open the *_Layout.cshtml* file.

1. You see the following line in `<div class="navbar-header">`.

    ```csharp
    @Html.ActionLink("Azure Cache for Redis Test", "RedisCache", "Home", new { area = "" }, new { @class = "navbar-brand" })
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="media/cache-web-app-howto/cache-welcome-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of welcome page.":::

### Showing data from the cache

From the home page, you select **Azure Cache for Redis Test** to see the sample output.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Views** folder, and then right-click the **Home** folder. 

1. You should see this code in the *RedisCache.cshtml* file.

    ```csharp
    @{
        ViewBag.Title = "Azure Cache for Redis Test";
    }

    <h2>@ViewBag.Title.</h2>
    <h3>@ViewBag.Message</h3>
    <br /><br />
    <table border="1" cellpadding="10">
        <tr>
            <th>Command</th>
            <th>Result</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>@ViewBag.command1</td>
            <td><pre>@ViewBag.command1Result</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>@ViewBag.command2</td>
            <td><pre>@ViewBag.command2Result</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>@ViewBag.command3</td>
            <td><pre>@ViewBag.command3Result</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>@ViewBag.command4</td>
            <td><pre>@ViewBag.command4Result</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>@ViewBag.command5</td>
            <td><pre>@ViewBag.command5Result</pre></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    ```

## Run the app locally

By default, the project is configured to host the app locally in [IIS Express](/iis/extensions/introduction-to-iis-express/iis-express-overview) for testing and debugging.

### To run the app locally

1. In Visual Studio, select **Debug** > **Start Debugging** to build and start the app locally for testing and debugging.

1. In the browser, select **Azure Cache for Redis Test** on the navigation bar.

1. In the following example, the `Message` key previously had a cached value, which was set by using the Azure Cache for Redis console in the portal. The app updated that cached value. The app also executed the `PING` and `CLIENT LIST` commands.

## Publish and run in Azure

After you successfully test the app locally, you can deploy the app to Azure and run it in the cloud.

### To publish the app to Azure

1. In Visual Studio, right-click the project node in Solution Explorer. Then select **Publish**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/cache-web-app-howto/cache-publish-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing publish button.":::

1. Select **Microsoft Azure App Service**, select **Create New**, and then select **Publish**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/cache-web-app-howto/cache-publish-to-app-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to publish to App Service.":::

1. In the **Create App Service** dialog box, make the following changes:

    | Setting | Recommended value | Description |
    | ------- | :---------------: | ----------- |
    | **App name** | Use the default. | The app name is the host name for the app when it's deployed to Azure. The name might have a timestamp suffix added to it to make it unique if necessary. |
    | **Subscription** | Choose your Azure subscription. | This subscription is charged for any related hosting costs. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, verify that the subscription that you want is selected.|
    | **Resource group** | Use the same resource group where you created the cache (for example, *TestResourceGroup*). | The resource group helps you manage all resources as a group. Later, when you want to delete the app, you can just delete the group. |
    | **App Service plan** | Select **New**, and then create a new App Service plan named *TestingPlan*. <br />Use the same **Location** you used when creating your cache. <br />Choose **Free** for the size. | An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run with. |

    :::image type="content" source="media/cache-web-app-howto/cache-create-app-service-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the App Service dialog box.":::

1. After you configure the App Service hosting settings, select **Create**.

1. Monitor the **Output** window in Visual Studio to see the publishing status. After the app has been published, the URL for the app is logged:

   :::image type="content" source="media/cache-web-app-howto/cache-publishing-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot publishing information in the output pane.":::

### Add the app setting for the cache

After the new app has been published, add a new app setting. This setting is used to store the cache connection information.

#### To add the app setting

1. Type the app name in the search bar at the top of the Azure portal to find the new app you created.

   :::image type="content" source="media/cache-web-app-howto/cache-find-app-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to find the app on the Azure portal.":::

2. Add a new app setting named **CacheConnection** for the app to use to connect to the cache. Use the same value you configured for `RedisHostName` in your *web.config* file.

### Run the app in Azure

1. In your browser, go to the URL for the app. The URL appears in the results of the publishing operation in the Visual Studio output window. It's also provided in the Azure portal on the overview page of the app you created.

1. Select **Azure Cache for Redis Test** on the navigation bar to test cache access as you did with the local version.
