# Azure CDN from Edgio retirement FAQ

Azure CDN from Edgio will be retired on January 15, 2025. You must migrate your workload to Azure Front Door before this date to avoid service disruption. This article provides answers to common questions about the retirement of Azure CDN from Edgio.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why was the retirement date of Azure CDN from Edgio changed from November 4, 2025, to January 15, 2025?

Edgio has informed us that their platform is now scheduled to shut down on January 15, 2025. Therefore, all Azure CDN from Edgio customers must migrate their workloads to Azure Front Door or other CDN services before this date.

### I see Edgio filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Can Microsoft guarantee that Azure CDN from Edgioâ€™s availability and services until November 4, 2025?

Edgio informed us that their services remain operational until at least January 15, 2025. However, we can't guarantee that Edgio doesn't unexpectedly cease operations before this date due to circumstances beyond our control.

### What options do I have with migrating my workloads from Azure CDN from Edgio?

You're encouraged to migrate your workloads to Microsoft's flagship CDN product called Azure Front Door Standard or Premium. Next steps:
1. Review [Azure Front Door and Azure CDN features](../frontdoor/front-door-cdn-comparison.md) to determine if Azure Front Door is compatible with your workload(s).
2. Understand [Azure Front Door Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/frontdoor/).
3. Follow the [Azure CDN to Azure Front Door migration guide](../frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door.md). This guide provides detailed instructions on how to set up an Azure Front Door profile, test functionality, and migrate your compatible workloads from Azure CDN from Edgio to Azure Front Door with the help of Azure Traffic Manager.

### If I determine my workload isn't a match for Azure Front Door, what are my options?

Consider whether Akamai or another CDN provider might be compatible with your needs. You can explore Akamai options through Azure Marketplace. If you decide to work with Akamai, contact Microsoft Support for assistance, and we can connect you with the Akamai team dedicated to migrations.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Marketplace is currently unavailable for customers in South Korea.

### If I determined my workload isn't a match for Azure Front Door, what are my options?

If you find that Azure Front Door isn't suitable for your workload, we offer an alternative service called [Routing Preference Unmetered](../virtual-network/ip-services/routing-preference-unmetered.md), also known as "CDN Interconnect." This service might allow free data transfer for traffic egressing from your Azure resources to another CDN of your choice.

### Does Microsoft validate my workloads work on Azure Front Door?

You need to determine if Azure Front Door suits your workloads. We recommend setting up a test environment to validate that your services are compatible with Azure Front Door.

### What will happen if I don't take action before January 15, 2025?

If no action is taken before January 15, 2025, Azure CDN from Edgio profiles and associated data will be removed from Edgio systems. It's imperative that users migrate their workloads before this date to avoid any service disruptions and data loss.

### How is Microsoft communicating the retirement of Azure CDN from Edgio, and how often are reminders sent?

We communicate the retirement of Azure CDN from Edgio through multiple channels, including email notifications and in-portal messages. Reminders are sent at least monthly to all users with active Edgio profiles to ensure they're aware of the upcoming changes and necessary actions.

### When will it no longer be possible to create new Azure CDN from Edgio profiles?

New Azure CDN from Edgio profiles can't be created after December 13, 2024.

### Can I request an extension for the retirement/shutdown of the Azure CDN from Edgio service?
