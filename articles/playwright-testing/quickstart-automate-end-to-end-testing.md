# Quickstart: Set up continuous end-to-end testing with Microsoft Playwright Testing Preview

In this quickstart, you set up continuous end-to-end testing with Microsoft Playwright Testing Preview to validate that your web app runs correctly across different browsers and operating systems with every code commit and troubleshoot tests easily using the service dashboard. Learn how to add your Playwright tests to a continuous integration (CI) workflow, such as GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, or other CI platforms.

After you complete this quickstart, you have a CI workflow that runs your Playwright test suite at scale and helps you troubleshoot tests easily with Microsoft Playwright Testing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Playwright Testing is currently in preview. For legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability, see the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

* A Microsoft Playwright Testing workspace. Complete the [quickstart: run Playwright tests at scale](./quickstart-run-end-to-end-tests.md) to create a workspace.

# [GitHub Actions](#tab/github)
- A GitHub account. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can [create one for free](https://github.com/).
- A GitHub repository that contains your Playwright test specifications and GitHub Actions workflow. To create a repository, see [Creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).
- A GitHub Actions workflow. If you need help with getting started with GitHub Actions, see [create your first workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart)
- Set up authentication from GitHub Actions to Azure. See [Use GitHub Actions to connect to Azure](/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure)

# [Azure Pipelines](#tab/pipelines)
- An Azure DevOps organization and project. If you don't have an Azure DevOps organization, you can [create one for free](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project).
- A pipeline definition. If you need help with getting started with Azure Pipelines, see [create your first pipeline](/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline).
- Azure Resource Manager Service connection to securely authenticate to the service from Azure Pipelines, see [Azure Resource Manager service connection](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure)

## Get the service region endpoint URL

In the service configuration, you have to provide the region-specific service endpoint. The endpoint depends on the Azure region you selected when creating the workspace.

To get the service endpoint URL and store it as a CI workflow secret, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Playwright portal](https://aka.ms/mpt/portal) with your Azure account.

1. On the workspace home page, select **View setup guide**.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you have multiple workspaces, you can switch to another workspace by selecting the workspace name at the top of the page, and then select **Manage all workspaces**.

1. In **Add region endpoint in your setup**, copy the service endpoint URL.

    The endpoint URL matches the Azure region that you selected when creating the workspace.

1. Store the service endpoint URL in a CI workflow secret:

    | Secret name | Value |
    | ----------- | ------------ |
    | *PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL* | Paste the endpoint URL you copied previously. |

## Add service configuration file

If you haven't configured your Playwright tests yet for running them with service, add a service configuration file to your repository. In the next step, you then specify this service configuration file on the Playwright CLI.

1. Create a new file `playwright.service.config.ts` alongside the `playwright.config.ts` file.

    Optionally, use the `playwright.service.config.ts` file in the [sample repository](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-testing-service/blob/main/samples/get-started/playwright.service.config.ts).

2. Add the following content to it:

    :::code language="typescript" source="~/playwright-testing-service/samples/get-started/playwright.service.config.ts":::

   By default, the service configuration enables you to:
   - Accelerate build pipelines by running tests in parallel using cloud-hosted browsers.
   - Simplify troubleshooting with easy access to test results and artifacts published to the service.

   However, you can choose to use either of these features or both. See [How to use service features](./how-to-use-service-features.md#manage-features-while-running-tests) and update the service configuration file as per your requirements. 

3. Save and commit the file to your source code repository.

## Update package.json file 

Update the `package.json` file in your repository to add details about Microsoft Playwright Testing service package in `devDependencies` section.

```typescript
"devDependencies": {
    "@azure/microsoft-playwright-testing": "^1.0.0-beta.6"
}
```

## Enable artifacts in Playwright configuration 

In the `playwright.config.ts` file of your project, make sure you are collecting all the required artifacts.
```typescript
  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    video:'retain-on-failure',
    screenshot:'on'
  },
  ```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="nunit-test-runner"
## Set up service configuration 

1. Create a new file `PlaywrightServiceSetup.cs` in the root directory of your project. This file facilitates authentication of your client with the service. 
2. Add the following content to it:

    :::code language="csharp" source="~/playwright-testing-service/samples/.NET/NUnit/PlaywrightServiceSetup.cs":::

3. Save and commit the file to your source code repository.

## Install service package

In your project, install Microsoft Playwright Testing package. 

```PowerShell
dotnet add package Azure.Developer.MicrosoftPlaywrightTesting.NUnit --prerelease
```

This updates your project's `csproj` file by adding the service package details to the `ItemGroup` section. Remember to commit these changes.

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Azure.Developer.MicrosoftPlaywrightTesting.NUnit" Version="1.0.0-beta.2" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

## Add or update `.runsettings` file for your project. 

If you haven't configured your Playwright tests yet for running them with service, add `.runsettings` file to your repository. In the next step, you then specify this service configuration file on the Playwright CLI.

1. Create a new `.runsettings` file.

    Optionally, use the `.runsettings` file in the [sample repository](https://aka.ms/mpt/nunit-runsettings).

2. Add the following content to it:

    :::code language="xml" source="~/playwright-testing-service/samples/.NET/NUnit/.runsettings":::

   The settings in this file enable you to:
   - Accelerate build pipelines by running tests in parallel using cloud-hosted browsers.
   - Publish test results and artifacts to the service for faster troubleshooting.

   However, you can choose to use either of these features or both. See [How to use service features](./how-to-use-service-features.md#manage-features-while-running-tests) and update the service configuration file as per your requirements. 

3. Save and commit the file to your source code repository.

## Enable artifacts in your Playwright setup 

Enable artifacts such as screenshot, videos and traces to be captured by Playwright. 
- For screenshots, see [capture screenshots](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/screenshots#introduction)
- For videos, see [record videos for your tests](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/videos#introduction)
- For traces, see [recording a trace](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/trace-viewer-intro#recording-a-trace)

Once you collect these artifacts, attach them to the `TestContext` to ensure they are available in your test reports. For more information, see our [sample project for NUnit](https://aka.ms/mpt/nunit-sample)

3. Save and commit your changes.

    When the CI workflow is triggered, your Playwright tests run in your Microsoft Playwright Testing workspace on cloud-hosted browsers, across 20 parallel workers. The results and artifacts collected are published to the service and can be viewed on service portal.


The settings for your test run can be defined in `.runsettings` file. For more information, see [how to use service package options](./how-to-use-service-config-file.md#config-options-in-runsettings-file)

> [!NOTE]
> Reporting feature is enabled by default for existing workspaces. This is being rolled out in stages and will take a few days. To avoid failures, confirm that `Rich diagnostics using reporting` setting is ON for your workspace before proceeding. For more information, see, [Enable reporting for workspace](./how-to-use-service-features.md#manage-feature-for-the-workspace).

> [!CAUTION]
> With Microsoft Playwright Testing, you get charged based on the number of total test minutes consumed and test results published. If you're a first-time user or [getting started with a free trial](./how-to-try-playwright-testing-free.md), you might start with running a single test at scale instead of your full test suite to avoid exhausting your free test minutes and test results.
>
> After you validate that the test runs successfully, you can gradually increase the test load by running more tests with the service.
>
::: zone pivot="playwright-test-runner"

> You can run a single test with the service by using the following command-line:

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="nunit-test-runner"

[!INCLUDE [View test runs and results in the Playwright portal](./includes/include-playwright-portal-view-test-results-nunit.md)]

::: zone-end


> [!TIP]
> You can use Microsoft Playwright Testing service features independently. You can publish test results to the portal without using the cloud-hosted browsers feature and you can also use only cloud-hosted browsers to expedite your test suite without publishing test results. For details, see [How to use service features](./how-to-use-service-features.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The test results and artifacts that you publish are retained on the service for 90 days. After that, they are automatically deleted.
