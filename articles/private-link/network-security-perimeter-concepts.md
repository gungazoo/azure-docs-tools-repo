# What is Network Security Perimeter?

Network Security Perimeter allows organizations to define a logical network isolation boundary for PaaS resources (for example, Azure Storage account and SQL Database server) that are deployed outside your organization’s virtual networks. It restricts public network access to PaaS resources within the perimeter; access can be exempted by using explicit access rules for public inbound and outbound.

For access patterns involving traffic from virtual networks to PaaS resources, see [What is Azure Private Link?](private-link-overview.md).

Features of Network Security Perimeter include:

- Resource to resource access communication within perimeter members, preventing data exfiltration to non-authorized destinations.
- Manage external public access with explicit rules for PaaS resources associated with the perimeter.
- Access logs for audit and compliance.
- Unified experience across PaaS resources.

## Components of Network Security Perimeter

A network security perimeter includes the following components:

| **Component** |**Description**|
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network security perimeter** | Top level resource defining logical network boundary to secure PaaS resources. |
| **Profile** | Collection of access rules that apply on resources associated with the profile. |
| **Access rule**| Inbound and outbound rules for resources in a perimeter to allow access outside the perimeter. |
| **Resource association** | Perimeter membership for a PaaS resource. |
| **Diagnostics settings** | Extension resource hosted by Microsoft Insights to collect logs & metrics for all resources in the perimeter. |

> [!NOTE]
> For organizational and informational safety, it is advised not to include any personally identifiable or sensitive data in the network security perimeter rules or other network security perimeter configuration.

## Network security perimeter properties

When creating a network security perimeter, you can specify the following properties:

| **Property** | **Description** |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Name** | A unique name within the resource group. |
| **Location** | A supported Azure region where the resource is located. |
| **Resource group name** | Name of the resource group where the network security perimeter should be present. |

## Access modes in network security perimeter

Administrators add PaaS resources to a perimeter by creating resource associations. These associations can be made in two access modes. The access modes are:

| **Mode** | **Description** |
|----------------|--------|
| **Learning mode**  | - Default access mode.</br>- Helps network administrators to understand the existing access patterns of their PaaS resources.</br>- Advised mode of use before transitioning to enforced mode.|
| **Enforced mode**  | - Must be set by the administrator.</br>- By default, all traffic except intra perimeter traffic is denied in this mode unless an *Allow* access rule exists. |


Learn more on transitioning from learning mode to enforced mode in [Transitioning to a network security perimeter](network-security-perimeter-transition.md) article.

## Why use Network Security Perimeter?

Network security perimeter provides a secure perimeter for communication of PaaS services deployed outside the virtual network. It allows you to control network access to Azure PaaS resources. Some of the common use cases include:

- Create a secure boundary around  PaaS resources.
- Prevent data exfiltration by associating PaaS resources  to the perimeter.
- Enable access rules to grant access outside the secure perimeter.
- Manage access rules for all the PaaS resources within the network security perimeter in a single pane of glass.
- Enable diagnostic settings to generate access logs of PaaS resources within the perimeter for Audit and Compliance.
- Allow private endpoint traffic without other access rules.


## How does Network Security Perimeter work?

When a network security perimeter is created and the PaaS resources are associated with the perimeter in enforced mode, all public traffic is denied by default thus preventing data exfiltration outside the perimeter.  

Access rules can be used to approve public inbound and outbound traffic outside the perimeter. Public inbound access can be approved using Network and Identity attributes of the client such as source IP addresses, subscriptions. Public outbound access can be approved using FQDNs (Fully Qualified Domain Names) of the external destinations. 

For example, upon creating a network security perimeter and associating a set of PaaS resources like Azure Key Vault and SQL DB in enforced mode, with the perimeter, all incoming and outgoing public traffic is denied to these PaaS resources by default. To allow any access outside the perimeter, necessary access rules can be created. Within the same perimeter, profiles may also be created to group PaaS resources with similar set of inbound and outbound access requirements.

## Onboarded private link resources
A network security perimeter-aware private link resource is a PaaS resource that can be associated with a network security perimeter. Currently the list of onboarded private link resources are as follows:

| Private link resource name | Resource type | Resources |
|---------------------------|---------------|-----------|
| [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/network-security-perimeter)             | Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionEndpoints</br>Microsoft.Insights/ScheduledQueryRules</br>Microsoft.Insights/actionGroups</br>Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces | Log Analytics Workspace, Application Insights, Alerts, Notification Service |
| [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/search-security-network-security-perimiter)          | Microsoft.Search/searchServices | - |
| [Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-configure-nsp)                | Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts | - |
| Event Hubs                | Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces | - |
| [Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/network-security#network-security-perimeter-preview)                 | Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults | - |
| [SQL DB](/azure/azure-sql/database/network-security-perimeter)                    | Microsoft.Sql/servers | - |
| [Storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#network-secuirty-perimeter-preview)               | Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts | - |

## Limitations of network security perimeter

### Regional limitations

Network security perimeter is currently available in all Azure public cloud regions. However, while enabling access logs for network security perimeter, the Log Analytics workspace to be associated with the network security perimeter needs to be located in one of the Azure Monitor supported regions. Currently, those regions are **East US**, **East US 2**, **North Central US**, **South Central US**, **West US**, and **West US 2**.

> [!NOTE]
> For PaaS resource logs, use **Storage and Event Hub** as the log destination for any region associated to the same perimeter.
