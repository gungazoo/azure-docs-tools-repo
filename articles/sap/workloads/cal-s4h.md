# SAP Cloud Appliance Library

[SAP Cloud Appliance Library](https://cal.sap.com/catalog?provider=208b780d-282b-40ca-9590-5dd5ad1e52e8) offers a quick and easy way to create SAP workloads in Azure. You can set up a fully configured demo environment from an Appliance Template or deploy a standardized system for an SAP product based on default or custom SAP software installation stacks. 
This page lists the latest Appliance Templates and below the latest SAP S/4HANA stacks for production-ready deployments. 

To deploy an appliance template, you'll need to authenticate with your S-User or P-User. You can create a P-User free of charge via the [SAP Community](https://community.sap.com/).
